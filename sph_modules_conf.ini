[vcftools]
description=A program package designed for working with VCF files, such as those generated by the 1000 Genomes Project. The aim of VCFtools is to provide methods for working with VCF files: validating, merging, comparing and calculate some basic population genetic statistics.

[rpy2]
description=rpy2 is a redesign and rewrite of rpy. It is providing a low-level interface to R, a proposed high-level interface, including wrappers to graphical libraries, as well as R-like structures and functions.

[beagle]
description=BEAGLE is a software program for imputing genotypes, inferring haplotype phase, and performing  genetic association analysis.  BEAGLE is designed to  analyze large-scale  data sets with hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped on thousands of samples. BEAGLE can phase genotype data  (i.e. infer haplotypes) for unrelated individuals,  parent-offspring pairs, and parent-offspring trios. infer sporadic missing genotype data. impute ungenotyped markers that have been genotyped in a reference panel. perform single marker and haplotypic association analysis.  detect genetic regions that are shared  homozygous-by-descent (HBD) or identical-bydescent (IBD).

[impute]
description=MPUTE version 2 (also known as 'IMPUTE2') is a genotype imputation and phasing program based on ideas from Howie et al. (2009). Please click on the links below to download the software or learn how to use it.

[mach]
description=MACH 1.0 is a Markov Chain based haplotyper. It can resolve long haplotypes or infer missing genotypes in samples of unrelated individuals.

[minimac]
description=minimac is a low memory, computationally efficient implementation of the MaCH algorithm for genotype imputation. It is designed to work on phased genotypes and can handle very large reference panels with hundreds or thousands of haplotypes. The name has two parts. The first, 'mini', refers to the modest amount of computational resources it requires. The second, 'mac', is short hand for MaCH, our widely used algorithm for genotype imputation.

[plink]
description=PLINK is a free, open-source whole genome association analysis toolset, designed to perform a range of basic, large-scale analyses in a computationally efficient manner.The focus of PLINK is purely on analysis of genotype/phenotype data, so there is no support for steps prior to this (e.g. study design and planning, generating genotype or CNV calls from raw data). Through integration with gPLINK and Haploview, there is some support for the subsequent visualization, annotation and storage of results.

[snptest]
description=SNPTEST is a program for the analysis of single SNP association in genome-wide studies. The tests implemented include: Binary (case-control) phenotypes, single and multiple quantitative phenotypes, Bayesian and Frequentist tests, Ability to condition upon an arbitrary set of covariates and/or SNPs, and Various different methods for the dealing with imputed SNPs.

[sip]
description=SIP is a tool that makes it very easy to create Python bindings for C and C++ libraries. It was originally developed to create PyQt, the Python bindings for the Qt toolkit, but can be used to create bindings for any C or C++ library.

[pyqt]
description=PyQt is a set of Python v2 and v3 bindings for Digia's Qt application framework and runs on all platforms supported by Qt including Windows, MacOS/X and Linux. PyQt4 supports Qt v4 and will build against Qt v5. PyQt5 supports Qt v5. The bindings are implemented as a set of Python modules and contain over 300 classes and over 6,000 functions and methods.
